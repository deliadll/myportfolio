Portfolio UX/UI Design

Welcome to my UX/UI Design Portfolio! This project showcases my skills, my curriculum, and various UX/UI design projects I have worked on.

The portfolio consists of the following key files and folders:

index.html: The main homepage of the portfolio. It includes an overview of my design projects, skills, and a brief introduction about myself as a designer.

curriculum.html: This page is dedicated to my professional resume, outlining my educational background, work experience, skills, and certifications.

/assets: This folder contains all the assets required for the portfolio:

images: Includes project images used throughout the portfolio. sass: Contains SASS files used to structure and organize CSS for the portfolio. bootstrap: Bootstrap files are used to provide a responsive grid system, components, and utilities that streamline the layout and design of the portfolio pages.
